# My shell scripts

Feel free to use them and suggest improvements.

## Overview

### irc

The purpose of the script is to connect to a remote IRC session
running in tmux. It's very minimal, but that's all I need right now.
I'd also like it to reconnect when my laptop wakes up, but I'm not
sure of the best way to do that.
